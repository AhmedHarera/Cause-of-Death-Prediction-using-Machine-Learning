# Cause-of-Death-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning
This project aims to build a machine learning model that predicts the cause of death based on clinical and demographic data. It demonstrates the full pipeline of data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization.

📌 Project Overview
This is a classification task using supervised learning. The dataset used contains features that may be linked to various causes of death, and the model is trained to predict one of the possible outcomes.

🧰 Technologies Used
Python 🐍

Jupyter Notebook

Pandas & NumPy – Data manipulation

Seaborn & Matplotlib – Visualization

Scikit-learn – Machine learning tools (SVM, metrics, encoding)

⚙️ How It Works
